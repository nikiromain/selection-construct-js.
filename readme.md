# Lab 2- Decision Making and Conditionals


1. Develop a program that will prompt the user to enter his or her age and if the user’s age is less than or equal to 18, display the following message: - age.js

“You are too young to go beyond this point”.


2. Modify Question 1 program so that if the person's age is greater than 18 years the program will print 

“You have been granted access”. age.js



3. Do the above question with a ternary operator - age-tenary.js

4. Develop a program that will receive two numbers from the keyboard.  Program should display to the screen the quotient of the two numbers.The quotient calculation (first number divided by the second number) is only to be performed if the second number does not equal zero. Display an appropriate error message if it is not - quotient.js

5. Develop a program that will prompt the user to enter an integer number and then display if the number entered by the user is a positive number or negative number. - positive-negatce.js


6. Develop a program that will prompt the user to enter a number and then display if the number is an odd or an even number. - odd-even.js

7. A student is given 3 tests, each marked out of 100. The student passes if their average mark is greater than or equal to 50 and fails if their average mark is less than 50.  Develop a program that will prompt the user for 3 marks and print “Pass” if the student passes and “Fail” if the student fails. - marks.js

8. A computer repair shop on Queen Street charges $100 for labour plus the cost of parts used to repair the device. However, the minimum charge for any job is $150. Write a program that will prompt the user for the number of hours  it took to report the device   and the cost of parts. Lastly, print the charge of the job. Do this question with an if else construct. - repair.js

9. Do the above program with an if construct instead of an if else.

10. Do the above program with a ternary operator instead of an if else of an if block.  repair-tenary.js


11. Develop a program which, when run, works as follows: - cars.js

Hi, what's your name ? Input: Mr.Smith
Welcome to our show, Mr Smith
How old are you? Input: 52
Hmmmm, you don’t look a day over 52. 
Tell me, Mr.Smith, how many cars do you own? 0
Wow, come on now Mr Smith, you are 52 and do not own a car!  
Note, if the user is less than 22 years then they should not be allowed to continue the game and should be forced to exit the game.
If the user owns a car or owns multiple cars then the rest of the program will work as follows: 
Mr Smith, what is the brand and model of your car? Input: Nissan B14
The Nissan B14 is a great choice for a car.
Mr Smith, have a great day. Good Bye!!

14. Develop a program which requests two weights in kilograms and grams and prints the sum of the weights. 

For example, if the weights are 3kg 500g and 4kg 700g , your program should print 8kg 200g. - weights.js

15. A home mortgage authority requires a deposit on a home loan according to the following schedule:
Loan $
    Deposit
less than $25 000
    5% of the loan value
$25 000–$49 999
   $1250 + 10% of loan over $25 000
$50 000–$100 000
$5000 + 25% of loan over $50 000

Loans in excess of $100 000 are not allowed. Develop a program that will read Loan
amount and compute and print the required deposit.

16. Design a program that will prompt an operator for a student name, number and the student's exam score out of 100. Your program is then to match the exam score to a letter grade and print the grade on the screen. Calculate the letter grade as follows:
90 and above
A
80–89.9
B
70–79.9
C
60–69.9
D
below 60
F

 17. Develop a program to read two pairs of integers. Each pair represents a fraction. For example, the pair 3 5 represents the fraction  3 / 5. Your program should then print the sum of the given fractions. 

	For example, given the pairs of 3 5 and 2 3 , your program should print 19/15
        3     +   2          =  19
         5 	3               15

18. Modify the program so that it prints the sum of the fraction reduced as a mixed number. For example, your  19/15  should be converted to 1  4 /15

19. All triangles have 3 sides and 3 angles which always add up to 180°. They are classified in two major ways that is:-
1) By the number of equal sides they have:
  • Scalene 
  • Isosceles  
  • Equilateral

2) By the types of angles they have:
  • Acute triangle
• Right triangle 
  	• Obtuse triangle 

You have been hired as a programmer by the Ministry of Education to develop a Java program 
for form 1 students. The said program should test students’ knowledge on the types of triangles, 
classified with regards to the number of equal sides they have. 

The program that you are to develop MUST prompt the user for 5 Triangles (inclusive of 
their dimensions), then print the type of triangle each triangle conforms to (that is, 
Scalene,  Isosceles and Equilateral) and lastly print the number of times each triangle was 
entered. 

Note, for each triangle you must prompt the user to enter all of its dimensions i.e., side 1,
side 2 and side 3. Also, a valid triangle must have sides greater than 0. Thus, if the user 
enters any side that is not greater than 0 then the triangle would be invalid and your 
program must state such.

Please see below for details with regards to Triangles that are classified according to the 
number of equal sides they have:-


Equilateral triangle: An equilateral triangle is a triangle that has three equal sides, thus all sides are equal to each other. The following is an equilateral triangle.


Isosceles triangle: An isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two equal sides, thus any two sides are equal to each other. The following is an isosceles triangle.

Scalene triangle: A scalene triangle is a triangle that has no equal sides thus; all sides are not equal to each other. The following is a scalene triangle.
