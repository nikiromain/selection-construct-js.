# Lab 2- Decision Making and Conditionals


1. Develop a program that will prompt the user to enter his or her age and if the user’s age is less than or equal to 18, display the following message: - age.js

“You are too young to go beyond this point”.


2. Modify Question 1 program so that if the person's age is greater than 18 years the program will print 

“You have been granted access”. age.js



3. Do the above question with a ternary operator - age-tenary.js

4. Develop a program that will receive two numbers from the keyboard.  Program should display to the screen the quotient of the two numbers.The quotient calculation (first number divided by the second number) is only to be performed if the second number does not equal zero. Display an appropriate error message if it is not - quotient.js

5. Develop a program that will prompt the user to enter an integer number and then display if the number entered by the user is a positive number or negative number. - positive-negatce.js


6. Develop a program that will prompt the user to enter a number and then display if the number is an odd or an even number. - odd-even.js

7. A student is given 3 tests, each marked out of 100. The student passes if their average mark is greater than or equal to 50 and fails if their average mark is less than 50.  Develop a program that will prompt the user for 3 marks and print “Pass” if the student passes and “Fail” if the student fails. - marks.js

8. A computer repair shop on Queen Street charges $100 for labour plus the cost of parts used to repair the device. However, the minimum charge for any job is $150. Write a program that will prompt the user for the number of hours  it took to report the device   and the cost of parts. Lastly, print the charge of the job. Do this question with an if else construct. - repair.js

9. Do the above program with an if construct instead of an if else.

10. Do the above program with a ternary operator instead of an if else of an if block.  repair-tenary.js


11. Develop a program which, when run, works as follows: - cars.js

Hi, what's your name ? Input: Mr.Smith
Welcome to our show, Mr Smith
How old are you? Input: 52
Hmmmm, you don’t look a day over 52. 
Tell me, Mr.Smith, how many cars do you own? 0
Wow, come on now Mr Smith, you are 52 and do not own a car!  
Note, if the user is less than 22 years then they should not be allowed to continue the game and should be forced to exit the game.
If the user owns a car or owns multiple cars then the rest of the program will work as follows: 
Mr Smith, what is the brand and model of your car? Input: Nissan B14
The Nissan B14 is a great choice for a car.
Mr Smith, have a great day. Good Bye!!

14. Develop a program which requests two weights in kilograms and grams and prints the sum of the weights. 

For example, if the weights are 3kg 500g and 4kg 700g , your program should print 8kg 200g. - weights.js
